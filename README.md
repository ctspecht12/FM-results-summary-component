## My process

I started with the html and separating the card into divs in preparation for using flexbox. Once the html was in place, I started styling the full card, then the results section on the left, followed by the summary section. I started with the background and shapes and then adjusted the text top to bottom. I used flexbox and switched it to columns for each side of the card and used flexbox properties to position the different elements.

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This project was a great opportunity to continue using flexbox, which I'm still fairly uncomfortable with, but am getting more comfortable with each project. I also was grateful for the opportunity to work with gradients and the hsla color format, which I don't have much experience with.

Also, was able to create extra breakpoints to accomodate all screensizes, which I think I'm starting to get a pretty good handle on.

### Continued development

I intend to continue working on flexbox and positioning and sizing. For example, I wanted to try to make the circle in the results section more responsive by making it 50% of the width, but then couldn't figure out how to make the height equal to the width, so ultimately I ended up making it a fixed size.
